This project presents an innovative handyman website connecting users with skilled professionals 
for tasks such as plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, bike repair, and furniture repair. With the 
rising demand for on-demand services, this platform provides a convenient and reliable way to find 
trusted handymen. Existing handyman websites often lack personalized recommendations, 
seamless communication, and dynamic feedback mechanisms, which can impact user satisfaction. 
To address this, the project integrates a recommendation system combining collaborative and 
content-based filtering to offer personalized service suggestions based on user preferences and past 
interactions. It is built using Flask for the backend due to its lightweight, flexible nature, and 
seamless integration with machine learning libraries to enhance recommendation accuracy. Key 
features include secure customer authentication, a rating system with dynamic updates based on 
user feedback, and personalized recommendations that improve over time.
